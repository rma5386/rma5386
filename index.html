     <div>
 <p>This is my first attempt at creating a personal website for myself. On this page you can read to learn a little bit more about me. One of the links will take you that briefly describes my research. If you need to contact me you can find that information on the contact me page. While the page is not finished there is a box that you can drag around.</p>

  <h3>Avid Sailor: +</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
Most of my life I grew up in a small town on the coast of Mississippi. Growing up on the coast was amazing because it allowed me to take up sailing as a hobby. From kindergarten to senior year of high school I was an avid sailor. I became the captain of the sailing team at my high school, were we became State Champions in a Team Racing Regatta, as well as qualified for the Baker and Mallory championship.

  <h3>Hurricane Katrina: +</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
One problem with growing up on the coast was dealing with hurricanes. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast. My family had evactuated to Florida and we soon learned that our house was detroyed. Eleven years later you can still see the impact Hurricane Katrina had on the Gulf Coast, but for the most part we have rebuilt.
