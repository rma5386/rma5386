<h2>About My Research: </h2>
    
<p>My primarily research focus is the learning trajectories, socilization, and barriers to participation in informal settings, specifically in Video games.</p>
    
<h2><em>Learning in Esports: +</em></h2>
    <p> I am currently working with two divisions of the university Esports club;  League of Legends and Street Fighter. Through the course of my study I will watch how these divisions grow, how teams form and how individuals learn from one another.</p>
   
<h2><em>Using Twitch.Tv to study video games in a naturalistic environment:</em></h2>
    <div>
    <p> Twitch.tv is a live-streaming website in which gamers broadcast their gameplay and connect with others with similar interests. Using a Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel spectators may communicate with other spectators as well as the broadcaster. Currently, Twitch is one of the most popular streaming sites in the world, with a user base around 45 million users worldwide (Ohannessian, 2014). </p>
    <p>Many broadcasters are able to make a living through their broadcasting, making money through advertisements and subscribers to their channels.  Research focusing on video games and how they may be used for educational purposes has been around since video games entered the market. However, one of the major limitations has been the lack of studies ran in a naturalistic environment. Most studies involve students being brought into the research lab space where they are sit down a play a game briefly. I beleive that Twitch can give us researchers a better glimpse into the world of video games and their benefits without distrubing the natural occuring communities. This will give researchers a better look into the types of interactions going on in the gaming world.</p></div>
